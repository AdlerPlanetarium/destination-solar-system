        Be space explorers in our Planet Explorers exhibition and investigate the mysterious, far away planet known as Planet X. Does the thought of exploring caves and tunnels in search of evidence of water or life get your family excited? One of our mission specialists will be on hand to help you take on the role as lead scientist in the Planet X Research Station. Get behind the wheel of one of our XMOVERS to explore the Planet X terrain in the name of science!

        After hypothesizing about your findings in Planet Explorers, proceed to the Definiti Space Theater to continue exploring the relationship between our Earth, Moon, and Sun. Join Coyote, a curious character adapted from Native American oral traditions, and watch Earth, Moon, & Sun as you both discover why these three objects work together as a system.

        Connect back to Earth, by helping scientists categorize a large community of animals that call the Serengeti their home. The popular Citizen Science project, Snapshot Serengeti, depends on citizens of Earth.

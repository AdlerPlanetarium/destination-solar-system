          Voyage into Our Solar System gallery and touch pieces of other worlds. Located in the heart of the gallery, specimens from the Moon, Mars and the asteroids Vesta and Ceres allow you to experience our solar system in a truly hands-on way. Virtual scientists are on hand to answer some frequently asked questions about meteorites and more. Just a stoneâ€™s throw away is a model of the historic Martian rover, Opportunity.

          Continue to marvel at human-kinds early explorations on Mars in our 3D presentation, Welcome to the Universe, in the Samuel C. Johnson Star Theater.  Welcome to the Universe takes the experienced traveler further into the Universe, but not before exploring how humans explored our Solar System during the 21st century.

          You too can be part of space exploration by joining the Citizen Science project, Planet Four, and assist scientists in the field by identifying and measuring features on the surface of Mars. Even in the year 2096, the human mind is far superior to computers at analyzing complexities of the Martian surface.

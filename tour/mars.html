        Voyage into Our Solar System gallery and touch pieces of other worlds. Located in the heart of the gallery, specimens from the Moon, Mars and the asteroids Vesta and Ceres allow you to experience our solar system in a truly hands-on way. Virtual scientists are on hand to answer some frequently asked questions about meteorites and more. Just a stone’s throw away is a model of the historic Martian rover, Opportunity.
